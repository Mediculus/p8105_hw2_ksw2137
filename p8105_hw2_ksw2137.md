# Introduction

R Markdown document for P8105 homework 2. Code chunk below shows that we
are loading the required packages in order to manipulate the imported
data.

# Problem 1 - Data Import for Mr. Trash Wheel, 2017 Precipitation, & 2018 Precipitation and Data Clean-up

We are loading datasets from the Healthy Harbor Water Wheel dataset,
particularly from the sheets: “Mr. Trash Wheel”, “2018 Precipitation”,
and “2017 Precipitation”. While the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset is generally
“tidy”, we will modify these further to make it easier to work with the
data. Dataset for precipitation from 2017 and 2018 were on separate
sheets and needed to be merged since we would like a combined dataset.

``` r
# Import excel sheet and piping to clean data for Mr. Trash Wheel
trash_wheel_data <- 
  read_excel("./data/trash_wheel/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
             sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel") %>%                         # Specifies which sheet to read
  janitor::clean_names() %>%                                        # renames column titles as x_y and lowercases
  select(-x15) %>%                                                  # removes the "x15"(comments)
  drop_na(year) %>%                                                 # drops any rows containing NA in "year" column
  mutate(
    date = format(date, format = "%d"),                             # Changes the date format from %y%m%d to %d
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0),                          # Rounds the numbers in sports_balls to integers
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls),                        # Converts type from double to integers
    month = str_to_lower(month)) %>%                                # Makes months to have lowercases
  select(dumpster, year, month, everything())                       # Re-arranges the column to be "tidier"

# separates sportsball column to be used somewhere else
col_sportball <- pull(trash_wheel_data, sports_balls)




# Reads the 2017 precipitation data
precip2017_data <- 
  read_excel("./data/trash_wheel/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
             sheet = "2017 Precipitation",                          # Specifies the sheet
             range = "A2:B14") %>%                                  # Specifies range of cells to be read
  janitor::clean_names() %>%                                        # turns column names to lowercases
  mutate(year = "2017") %>%                                         # Adds year column
  select(year, everything()) %>%                                    # Re-arrange so year is 1st column
  drop_na(total)                                                    # drops any blank cells in "total" column
  


# Reads the 2018 precipitation data    
precip2018_data <- 
  read_excel("./data/trash_wheel/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
             sheet = "2018 Precipitation",                          # Specifies the sheet
             range = "A2:B14") %>%                                  # Specifies range of cells to be read
  janitor::clean_names() %>%                                        # turns column names to lowercases
  mutate(year = "2018") %>%                                         # Adds year column
  select(year, everything()) %>%                                    # Re-arrange so year is 1st column 
  drop_na(total)                                                    # drops any blank cells in "total" column


# New dataframe that merged precip2017 and precip2018 by year, then month, then "total". 
merged_precip20178_data <- full_join(precip2017_data, precip2018_data, by = c("year", "month", "total")) %>% 
  mutate(month = str_to_lower(month.name[month])) %>%               # changes month from "1" to "january" and so on
  rename(monthly_precip = total)                                    # renames the total column to monthly_precip

# Pulls the monthly precipitate column for other uses
total_precip2018 <- sum(pull(precip2018_data, total))
```

Data from Mr. Trash Wheel was obtained from Healthy Harbor Water Wheel’s
website and contains a total of 14 variables containing 285 observations
each. Examples of particularly key variables included are
`volume_cubic_yards` (trash volume in cubic yards) and unique types of
trash such as `cigarette_butts` or `plastic_bottles`. Interestingly,
there were also `sports_balls` included, which has a total median of 8
balls per dumpster.

The precipitation data was less interesting; there were a total of 19
observations corresponding to each month and its precipitate, which is
under the `monthly_precip` column. The `year` identifier was added and
merged as it was not included in the original (already separated by
sheets). Unfortunately, the 2018 precipitation data was only up to July,
thus the 7 observations; consequently, total measured precipitation for
2018 was 23.5.

# Problem 2

Trying to make a merged data between polls, unemployment, and snp?? data
obtained from FiveThirtyEight, a website that focuses on graphs.

``` r
pols_month_data <- 
  read_csv("./data/538/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(col = mon, into = c("year", "month", "date"), "-") #%>% 
  #mutate(month = str_to_lower(month.name[month])) %>%

unemployment_data <- read_csv("./data/538/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemp_count"
  )

snp_data <- 
  read_csv("./data/538/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()
```

create a president variable taking values gop and dem, and remove
prez\_dem and prez\_gop; and remove the day variable.

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above.
For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month,
and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the
previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to
“long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and
ensuring that key variables take the same values.

Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment
into the result.

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each
dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the
dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

Note: we could have used a date variable as a key instead of creating
year and month keys; doing so would help with some kinds of plotting,
and be a more accurate representation of the data. Date formats are
tricky, though. For more information check out the lubridate package in
the tidyverse.

# Problem 3

This problem uses data from NYC Open data on the popularity of baby
names, and can be downloaded here.

Load and tidy the data. Note that, although these data may seem fairly
well formatted initially, the names of a categorical predictor and the
case structure of string variables changed over time; you’ll need to
address this in your data cleaning. Also, some rows seem duplicated, and
these will need to be removed (hint: google something like “dplyr remove
duplicate rows” to get started).

Produce a well-structured, reader-friendly table showing the rank in
popularity of the name “Olivia” as a female baby name over time; this
should have rows for ethnicities and columns for year. Produce a similar
table showing the most popular name among male children over time.

Finally, for male, white non-hispanic children born in 2016, produce a
scatter plot showing the number of children with a name (y axis) against
the rank in popularity of that name (x axis).
