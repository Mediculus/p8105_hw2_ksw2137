# Introduction

R Markdown document for P8105 homework 2. Code chunk below shows that we
are loading the required packages in order to manipulate the imported
data.

# Problem 1 - Data Import for Mr. Trash Wheel, 2017 Precipitation, & 2018 Precipitation and Data Clean-up

We are loading datasets from the Healthy Harbor Water Wheel dataset,
particularly from the sheets: “Mr. Trash Wheel”, “2018 Precipitation”,
and “2017 Precipitation”. While the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset is generally
“tidy”, we will modify these further to make it easier to work with the
data. Dataset for precipitation from 2017 and 2018 were on separate
sheets and needed to be merged since we would like a combined dataset.

``` r
# Import excel sheet and piping to clean data for Mr. Trash Wheel
trash_wheel_data <- 
  read_excel("./data/trash_wheel/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx",
             sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",                             # Specifies which sheet to read
             range = "A2:N336") %>%                                 # Specifies the cells imported
  janitor::clean_names() %>%                                        # renames column titles as x_y and lowercases
  drop_na(year) %>%                                                 # drops any rows containing NA in "year" column
  mutate(
    date = format(date, format = "%d"),                             # Changes the date format from %y%m%d to %d
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls, 0),                          # Rounds the numbers in sports_balls to integers
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls),                        # Converts type from double to integers
    month = str_to_lower(month)) %>%                                # Makes months to have lowercases
  select(dumpster, year, month, everything())                       # Re-arranges the column to be "tidier"




# Reads the 2017 precipitation data
precip2017_data <- 
  read_excel("./data/trash_wheel/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
             sheet = "2017 Precipitation",                          # Specifies the sheet
             range = "A2:B14") %>%                                  # Specifies range of cells to be read
  janitor::clean_names() %>%                                        # turns column names to lowercases
  mutate(year = "2017") %>%                                         # Adds year column
  select(year, everything())                                        # Re-arrange so year is 1st column
  

# Reads the 2018 precipitation data    
precip2018_data <- 
  read_excel("./data/trash_wheel/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", 
             sheet = "2018 Precipitation",                          # Specifies the sheet
             range = "A2:B14") %>%                                  # Specifies range of cells to be read
  janitor::clean_names() %>%                                        # turns column names to lowercases
  mutate(year = "2018") %>%                                         # Adds year column
  select(year, everything()) %>%                                    # Re-arrange so year is 1st column 
  drop_na(total)                                                    # drops blank cells in "total" column


# New dataframe that merged precip2017 and precip2018 by year, then month, then "total". 
merged_precip20178_data <- 
  full_join(precip2017_data, precip2018_data,             # Uses full join to
            by = c("year", "month", "total")) %>% 
  mutate(month = str_to_lower(month.name[month])) %>%     # changes month from "1" to "january" and so on
  rename(monthly_precip = total)                          # renames the total column to monthly_precip
```

Data from Mr. Trash Wheel was obtained from Healthy Harbor Water Wheel’s
website and while it’s not necessary to include the It contains a total
of 14 variables (categories, including dumpster \#) containing 285
observations each. Identifying variables are `dumpster`, `year`,
`month`, and `date`. We also have key variables that lists the total
amount of variables per dumpster collected at date `x`. Examples of
particularly key variables included are:

  - The trash `weight` (in tons)
  - Trash `volume_cubic_yards` (in cubic yards)
  - Amount of `cigarette_butts`, `plastic_bottles`, or `polystyrene` per
    dumpster.

Interestingly, there were also `sports_balls` included, which has a
total median of 8 balls per dumpster.

The precipitation data was less interesting; there were a total of 19
observations corresponding to each month (Jan 2017 - Jul 2018) and its
precipitate in inches, which is under the `monthly_precip` column. The
`year` identifier was added and merged as it was not included in the
original. Total measured precipitation for 2018 was 23.5 inches, taking
into account that the range of 2018 data was from Jan 2018 - Jul 2018.

# Problem 2 - S\&P 500 Index, Unemployment, and Presidency Polls Data

Making a merged data between polls, unemployment, and S\&P 500 Index
data obtained from FiveThirtyEight, a website that focuses on graphs.
Since structure is slightly different, we have to reorganize the table
and use the year & month as the identifier during
merging.

``` r
# Importing polls data, splot the y/m/d date into individual columns. Also changed month from numeric to 
# abbreviated form
pols_month_data <- 
  read_csv("./data/538/pols-month.csv") %>%                        # Reads the file

  select(year, month, close) %>%                    # Re-arrangement of columns
  arrange(year, month) %>%                          # Turn into ascending order (to match other df)
  mutate(month = str_to_lower(month.abb[month]))    # Change month from "1" to "jan", etc

The polls dataset were modified to contain `prez` column which signifies
which political party the presidency was under. This was obtained by

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each
dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the
dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

# Problem 3 - Baby Names Data Processing

We are using data from NYC Open on baby names’ popularity and will
create a table that shows “popularity ranking”.

## Importing baby data & cleaning up

Upon skimming the original `.csv` dataset, various issues with the
syntax of the data. These issues, while not, “critical”, needs to be
cleaned up so we could work easily with the data. Issues are:

  - Inconsistent categorization naming:
      - ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER vs. ASIAN AND PACI
      - BLACK NON HISPANIC vs. BLACK NON HISP
      - WHITE NON HISPANIC vs. WHITE NON HISP
  - Case structure of the names changed between 2012 - 2013 from
    “UPPERCASE” to “Name”
  - Many duplicated rows were spotted

<!-- end list -->

``` r
# Cleaning up the baby_names dataset
baby_names_data <-
  read_csv("./data/baby_names/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(childs_first_name = str_to_lower(childs_first_name),          # Changes specified columns to all lowercase
         ethnicity = str_to_lower(ethnicity),
         gender = str_to_lower(gender)) %>% 
  distinct(year_of_birth, gender, ethnicity, childs_first_name, count, rank, .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(
    ethnicity = str_replace(ethnicity, 
                            "asian and paci(?!fic islander)",
                            "asian and pacific islander"),
    ethnicity = str_replace(ethnicity,
                            "black non hisp(?!anic)",
                            "black non hispanic"),
    ethnicity = str_replace(ethnicity,
                            "white non hisp(?!anic)",
                            "white non hispanic"))
```

## Obtaining useful information from cleaned baby dataset

Now that the dataset is cleaned and tidied, we will pull 3 data subsets:

  - Ranking changes for Olivia (female) over time by ethnicity
  - Names for the male’s 1st rank each year by ethnicity
  - Graph of the counts from each rank of white non-hispanic males’ top
    100 born in 2016

<!-- end list -->

``` r
olivia_fem_rank_annual <- 
  baby_names_data %>% 
  filter(childs_first_name == "olivia", 
         gender == "female") %>% 
  select(-gender, -childs_first_name, -count) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year_of_birth,
              values_from = rank) %>% 
  select(ethnicity, "2011", "2012", "2013", "2014", "2015", "2016")


male_rank1_annual <- 
  baby_names_data %>% 
  filter(rank == 1, 
         gender == "male") %>% 
  select(-gender, -rank, -count) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year_of_birth,
              values_from = childs_first_name) %>% 
  select(ethnicity, "2011", "2012", "2013", "2014", "2015", "2016")



baby_names_data %>% 
  filter(year_of_birth == 2016, 
         gender == "male", 
         ethnicity == "white non hispanic") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = rank, y = count)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 0.15) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Top 100 Real Name Counts",
       subtitle = "for White, non-Hispanic Males Born in 2016",
       x = "Ranking from 1-100",
       y = "Real Counts") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 18),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 8))
```

Finally, for male, white non-hispanic children born in 2016, produce a
scatter plot showing the number of children with a name (y axis) against
the rank in popularity of that name (x axis).
